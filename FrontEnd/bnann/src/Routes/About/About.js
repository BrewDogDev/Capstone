      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>The sports industry is massive, and one of the most popular sports is basketball.
        Predicting the outcomes of basketball games is something that many experts and sports
        fanatics struggle doing. Additionally, we would like to help those who are interested in sports
        betting yet don’t know what teams to bet on. To do this, we have decided to create a free to
        use website that provides predictions on upcoming basketball games, based on a trained neural
        network.</div>
    <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <div>This project is important because it will impact the way that sports are analyzed. If the
      neural network can predict with accuracy, then it may become a valuable tool for experts and
      novices who wish to increase their sports I.Q. It may even impact determining factors behind
      expert’s sports predictions. If exceedingly successful, it could impact the game of basketball
      itself, and teams could use it as a tool for decision-making.
      This project was chosen to work on primarily because we are interested in Artificial
      Intelligence, specifically neural nets. We initially wanted to analyze the stock market but felt
      like that market had already been explored. Additionally, we are both involved in sports and
      enjoy the game of basketball. Basketball is in season; therefore, we can test our predictions in
      real-time. The idea connects various aspects of our personal lives with our favorite class
      (artificial intelligence) at Christopher Newport University. Even though we barely touched on
      neural networks in the class, combining individual knowledge with skills acquired throughout
      our three years at CNU will enable this project to be in reach.</div>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <div>The goal of this project will be to provide anyone interested in betting on basketball
      predictions on the week’s upcoming games. These predictions will be made by a trained neural
      network. This neural network will be trained on data from previous basketball games as well as
      current games to provide an accuracy of at least 58%.
      The project’s capability to predict with accuracy has greater implications on Computer
      Science. Neural networks are already becoming increasingly prevalent, and this would
      introduce the technology to sports analytics. If the project proves successful, it would spark
      interest in using neural networks for sports analyzing/predicting and perhaps have an impact
      on sports altogether. The more accurate the neural network is, the likelihood that the tool
      would be utilized on the field or court improves. Weighing different winning factors may cause
      teams to think differently before trading or picking up players, strategizing against other teams,
      and making decisions in general. If a tool can predict the outcomes of basketball games, the
      ability to predict season wins with differing players also becomes possible. Granted, the scope
      of our project will not extend to cover manually changing variables, but if the result is high
      demand, then the project can be built upon. Either way, our project will impact basketball,
      analyzing tactics, and sports in general if we’re able to reach high accuracy.</div>
